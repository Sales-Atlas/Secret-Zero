---

Analyze all major dependencies in @package.json and create a comprehensive analysis of:

1. Technology stack versions being used
2. Best practices for each major dependency
3. Compatibility notes between versions
4. Security considerations
5. Performance optimization tips

Reference @.claude/rules/tech-stack.md for existing tech stack guidelines.

Format your analysis as a detailed technical report organized by component (Core Framework, Authentication & Security, UI & Styling, Forms & Validation, Development Tools).

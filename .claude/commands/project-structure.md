description: Analyze and document project directory structure
---

Analyze the project structure and create a comprehensive documentation including:

1. List all source files and folders in the project
2. Identify important files and their purposes
3. Document directory organization patterns
4. Create clear structure overview

Reference @.claude/rules/project-structure.md for existing project structure guidelines.

Format your analysis as a structured document with:
- Root level configuration files explanation
- Source code structure breakdown (actions/, app/, components/, lib/)
- Configuration & documentation folders
- Important conventions and architectural patterns
- Security-related file organization
